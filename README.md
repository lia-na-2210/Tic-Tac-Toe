# Tic-Tac-Toe

Simple two-player game with inspiration from De Stijl style in combination with a play of primary colors. It is meant to be simple, clean, and minimalist. You can play the game here: https://lia-na-2210.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/

If I had more time I would have added more animations to the transitions for a more smooth expirience. Would also play a lot more into the De Stijl style by making the grid assimetrical. In regards to the code I would add a score system to keep track of the results of the game.
